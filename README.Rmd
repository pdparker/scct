<!-- badges: end -->

Many panel datasets contain codes that use a numeric system to code jobs. For 
example the [International Standard Classification of Occupations](https://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/). Often these
codes need to be translated into social class or socioeconomic codes. This 
package facilitates that. It is based on, but extends, the correspondence table
of [Ganzeboom & Treiman](http://www.harryganzeboom.nl/ismf/scaleapp.htm').


## Installation

You can install the released version of scct from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
#install.packages("scct")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pdparker/scct")
```


# Details

For EGP it is important to note that no distinction is made between classes 3 and 4 with code 3 used as a catch all for "Routine non-manual" jobs. Likewise, ISCO-88 contains no codes for self-employed or unemployed individuals. The convert function provides an argument to provide user-defined values for self-employed and unemployed. This will return 6 (for self-employed) and 12 (for unemployed). When ISEI or SIOPS is requested, user defined values are ignored and NA is returned.
